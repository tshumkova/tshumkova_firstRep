<p>Sometimes you get the sense that Pink Martini is just showing off. The self-described “little orchestra” tackles musical genre (classical, Latin, jazz) and language (English, French, Farsi, Armenian, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish, and even Xhosa) with sophistication and playfulness.
Founder and bandleader Thomas Lauderdale has been carrying out this vision since 1994. Since then, his ageless music has only gotten bolder and farther-reaching, while never shedding the sense of joy around which its sound revolves. Featuring a dozen musicians, Pink Martini performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and North America…it’s about time they made their way to Gainesville.</p><!--paragraph tag-->
